### FoodStorming
A web platform featuring gastronomic content and a variety of recipes created by a team of professionals.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was conceived for the third web development assignment at Coderhouse. It utilizes full Bootstrap with all the tools I have learned. In the almost final stage of the project, I implemented structural changes with SASS to adapt my framework as much as possible to BEM conventions, added some JavaScript details, animations, and applied SEO practices (improving image loading performance with the corresponding format, WEPB, using meta description, keywords, and social media links for better positioning).

All pages are fully functional and responsive up to mobile devices . Currently, in the recipe cards menu, you can only access the first recipe (chocolate mousse) to view the chosen design.
